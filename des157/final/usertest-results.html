            <h1>THREE SIGNIFICANT OBSERVATIONS</h1>    
            <h2>Rather than a hover, have the slideshow as automatic after the overlay</h2>
                <p>          
                    Due to the design changes I have made for the project, having the hovering action trigger the slideshow creates an awkward interaction. There is also no need for me to be so fixed on the hover action starting the element.
                </p>
                   
                <h2>There is an option to keep either the overlay or the scrolling pagination as a fixed navigation bar</h2>
                <p>Keeping the overlay would be working off of the current layout and design. It could also offer a bigger canvas to work with. The pagination is a design I would like to work with but it could take up a lot of space. </p>
     
                <h2>Have the hover slideshow turn into a regular slow slideshow or a interactive slideshow</h2>
                <p>Rather than going along with the inspiration of a fast and curiosity spiking rapid slideshow, it would be nice for the audience to see each housemate and get to know them. A slideshow with arrows to navigate through each image could offer caption opportunities for each photo.</p>
                <div id="images">
                <img src="result1.jpg" alt="User 1" style="width:30%">
                <img src="result2.jpg" alt="User 2" style="width:30%">
                <img src="result3.jpg" alt="User 3" style="width:30%">

            PLAN FOR FINAL PROJECT UPDATE
        </h1>
        <p>For my final project, I will most likely use a horizontal bar at the top of the screen with all of the names that will trigger overlays with the images. By doing so, I will have the most available space and I could feature every person with a different aesthetic. However, I may still go with the pagination bar on the side that will scroll through the page and use small icons instead of each person’s name. I will have to think of how to design each person’s biography page and whether or not I want to introduce new background options of the images. Lastly, I need to review each picture to make sure the proportions are correct.
