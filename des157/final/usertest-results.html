            <h2>Final Project Brief</h2>
            <h3>NOV 26, 2021</h3>
  
            <!-- project summary -->
                <p>I will be developing my Studio 3 "Every Picture" project by adding styling for the pictures and exploring different layout options.</p>
                <p>          
                The veedoo.io website shares a similar style of a slideshow background with interactions included on top. The site uses unique transitions that make use of the vertical lines to create a mirror-like aesthetic. The side hovers interrupt the slideshow in the back by overlaying the screen with white. Further examination of the background will become possible by altering the landing page text position. Overall, the design enables a dynamic experience through images and the large font that appears on hover. 
                </p>

                    <img src="images/veedoo.jpg" alt="Veedoo" style="width:100%">
                    <figcaption>Fig.1 - <a href="https://veedoo.io/">Veedoo.io</a>
                    </figcaption>
                    </figure>
                <p>The hovercraft studio website incorporates a video for their background. Parts of the video consist of fast slideshows, showing similarities with my design. While having a dark overlay, the audience can still see it clearly and pay attention. The design choice also creates a contrast to enhance the text, menu, and sidebar. The simple user interaction that rotates the sidebar invites engagement and easy navigation through the images. One design to improve is the menu button. The square icon does not communicate its intention to the audience and confuses us.</p>

                    <img src="images/hovercraft.jpg" alt="Hovercraft" style="width:100%">
                    <figcaption>Fig.2 - <a href="https://hovercraftstudio.com/">hovercraftstudio.com</a>
                  </figcaption>
                  </figure>
                <p>A goal for my project is to expand it beyond the single-screen limitations to include more information. A similarity with the veedoo website is that both designs have a hover interaction disrupting a dynamic background. A design choice I can incorporate from hovercraft in my final project is a dark overlay. However, I would have to be cautious of the images I use. Whether it be editing the brightness of visuals or choosing pictures with enough contrast. One feedback I received for my project was related to adding a bio for each person. Navigating through the hovercraft pages gave me the idea to link the names to individual pages or overlays. Thus, I can include more information with scrolling, expanding it beyond the limited space. A specific interaction strategy I am planning is to interrupt the background slideshow on a hover. The veedoo website gave me the idea to cover up the screen rather than code for replacing animations. A desired experience for the users is to get a glimpse into my life with friendly but chaotic housemates. I plan to achieve it through my initial idea of a changing slideshow and new interactions or designs that create a friendly or calm aesthetic.</p>
