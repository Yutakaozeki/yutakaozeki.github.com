	<h1>Brian</h1>
	<p>Brian is one of the most mysterious housemates I have had throughout college. He will stay awake until 5-6am for no reason, punch me in the gut for no reason, take multiple power naps a day, the list goes on.</p>
	<p>He loves being at his Davis apartment but goes back to his family multiple times throughout the quarter.</p>

	<h1>Fiona</h1>
	<p>Fiona is a very outgoing individual and sometimes I wonder how. If she's at home you will know because she's either talking with one of the housemates or screaming while playing video games.</p>
	<p>She probably thinks that she is a responsible individual which outside of home may be true, but at home she is a literal child.</p>

	<h1>Gennifer</h1>
	<p>Gennifer is a ambitious person who has too much on her plate at times. She is the most health conscious out of everyone at home and her cooking seems very healthy. She is a design major just like me so our conversations are primarily centered around projects or opportunities.</p>
	<p>Gennifer can sometimes be slow with understanding our sarcasms, and proves to be tough since everyone in the house is very sarcastic.</p>

	<h1>Kevin</h1>
	<p>Kevin is a hard-working individual when it comes to his career. I have seen this man grinding since freshman year to secure the bag and I respect that part of him. He loves to party and loves gossiping. I think that he should start coming out of his room more to talk to the housemates.</p>
	<p>Kevin is one of the most-changed-since-freshman floormates that I have had. He has gone from looking like a innocent high schooler to a frat boi looking dude.</p>

	<h1>Steven</h1>
	<p>Steven is one of my freshman floormates that I only really got to know more through living with him. He loves to troll and is sometimes a compulsive liar because of that. He loves to talk about his roommates a lot and expoosing them about stuff they have told him.</p>
	<p>Steven is actually pretty responsible when he is acting normal and not being a troll. He is leaving after this quarter but I hope we can keep in touch even after he leaves.</p>

	<h1>Tuan</h1>
	<p>Tuan is one of the nicest people I will ever meet. He is pretty studious but gets the fear or missing out just like me. WE both end up staying up if our other housemates are talking and regret it in the morning. Tuan has recently started working with me and it has been a fun experience seeing him at work.</p>
	<p>Tuan is the most responsible housemate when it comes to house matters. He will do whatever he can to keep the house clean and organized.</p>

	<h1>Wislam</h1>
	<p>Wislam is my roommate for this year. He is always in a good mood and smiling, laughing at even the smallest things. Sometimes I wonder how he laughs so much, especially at vines or memes that he has repeatedly looked at. Wislam has good fashion sense and always loves to dress nicely for school and any occassion.</p>
	<p>Wislam is very particular about his daily routines and it looks like he is in control of his life most of the time. He is a good listener and loves to talk whenever he has the time to.</p>
