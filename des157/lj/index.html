                While it may not seem like it, online forms contain several aspects of UX that people subconsciously appreciate. From reviewing personal experiences, label positioning is crucial as they serve as visual cues for inputs. Most forms I have filled out avoid inline labels, exemplifying how usability decreases when labels disappear. The effort to minimize the cognitive load of the user can make form bearable. It is evident through giving form feedbacks that specify what kind of error there is, minimizing input fields and dropdown menus, and marking the few optional fields instead of mandatory fields.

                Although having a good site layout is important, forms require attention since they gather user data. Without visual encouragement by showing a clear picture of progress or maximized accessibility through tab-ready and matching keyboard options, websites will not be able to get the user engagement they desire. The information that masking passwords don't increase security is surprising but makes sense as passwords are considered sensitive information. Thus, hiding it makes it feel confidential.

                Photoworks, a San Francisco photo processing shop, employs some of these form strategies on their website. When submitting orders for film, they use a one-column layout, size fields accordingly, and provide a visual for the number of steps necessary to complete. Even when working with form submission for film, the well-structured design made the process stress-free.
