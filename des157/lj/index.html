                </figure>
                <p>
                    The image captures a random object that littered the floor. I am unsure what the piece of trash is, but it is thrown away against the wall. Besides the trash, the person has nice black shoes on that also attract the audience's attention.

                    The most interesting aspect of this image is that we can feel disappointment or confusion through the picture. Maybe the person knew what the object is or they were equally as confused as me. The angle of the picture gives some visual distortion while the lines give a direction to follow.

                    The most obvious aspect is that it is a point of view from the person who approached the trash. The most mysterious part to me is the object itself. The handles make me want to grab it, but just the fact of it being on the ground is enough to stop me from approaching it.

                    This image is interesting as it captures the chaotic and inclusive nature of my house’s daily life. Since I live with seven housemates, there are always some people gathered together at the dining table. We do most things together and talk a lot about anything and everything. The two housemates collaged into the picture were sleeping at the time, but my housemate made sure to include them. Visually, everyone is staring at the camera but with completely different expressions. Some smile, some look serious, and one person does not notice what is going on. This image relates to the archive of my housemates and me. It is an example of the inclusive atmosphere at home that I, fortunately, get to end my day in.

                    It tells the story of a cheerful and energetic household that college circumstances create. While struggling with school work or personal relationships, we still love to hang out and get to know each other more. It is extra enjoyable for me since most of them are from my freshman floor.

                The website by <a href="https://micdropagency.com/">MicDrop Agency</a> serves as a great example of the use of images and interaction on a website. Just as the article by Michael Gonchar mentions that students often compete as to who could see the most of a photo’s back story, MicDrop Agency introduces a similar idea. What seems to be an overwhelming array of images is a clever tactic to grab attention. With the rapid cycle of multiple images accompanied with hovers, people try to interpret as much information as possible. It tests our cognitive ability and attention to detail within a short time frame. Users can compare themselves to others on how much they remember and understand from the interaction. Once the user stops hovering, the images begin to cycle slowly. This manipulation of speed gives control of pacing to the user, inviting them to interact in their way with the website.  
            </p>
             <p>          
                The fast cycle also introduces ambiguity to what the user viewed. When asked about the context of the image, it is more likely that there will be multiple inaccurate answers. However, it brings to light the different focal points and creation of a story using small clues. Thus the MicDrop Agency website is fascinating in grabbing attention and invoking our short-term memory.

            <h2>OVERUSE OF OVERLAYS: HOW TO AVOID MISUSING LIGHTBOXES</h2>

                    Overlays are a helpful design tool: when used correctly. It can eliminate the hassle of creating new pages or modifying the navigation. It often makes sense to use them on long web pages to provide quick access to information. However, the opinion on overlays from a designer's perspective and a user's changes drastically. Recalling my personal experience, I have also used lightboxes to have a design work in my favor. When doing so, I did not consider the problems it creates but rather how convenient the feature is for me. 
                </p>
                <p>          
                    The article caught my attention for the WHO and WHEN considerations. Disorientation for mobile users requires attention to detail, and I had not thought of the possibility of screen-magnifier users. For the WHEN, it makes sense to introduce overlays before a user works on their task. Or, if the overlay is their goal, then having it user-initiated gives control to the user. Overall, the article made me rethink the purposes of overlays and how they should only display for urgent matters or data collection.

                <h2>BEST PRACTICES FOR FORM DESIGN</h2>
               
                </section>
                <section class="second">
                    <h4>01</h4>
                    <p>
                        While it may not seem like it, online forms contain several aspects of UX that people subconsciously appreciate. From reviewing personal experiences, label positioning is crucial as they serve as visual cues for inputs. Most forms I have filled out avoid inline labels, exemplifying how usability decreases when labels disappear. The effort to minimize the cognitive load of the user can make form bearable. It is evident through giving form feedbacks that specify what kind of error there is, minimizing input fields and dropdown menus, and marking the few optional fields instead of mandatory fields. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Although having a good site layout is important, forms require attention since they gather user data. Without visual encouragement by showing a clear picture of progress or maximized accessibility through tab-ready and matching keyboard options, websites will not be able to get the user engagement they desire. The information that masking passwords don't increase security is surprising but makes sense as passwords are considered sensitive information. Thus, hiding it makes it feel confidential.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Photoworks, a San Francisco photo processing shop, employs some of these form strategies on their website. When submitting orders for film, they use a one-column layout, size fields accordingly, and provide a visual for the number of steps necessary to complete. Even when working with form submission for film, the well-structured design made the process stress-free.
