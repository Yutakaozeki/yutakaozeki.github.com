                Overlays are a helpful design tool: when used correctly. It can eliminate the hassle of creating new pages or modifying the navigation. It often makes sense to use them on long web pages to provide quick access to information. However, the opinion on overlays from a designer's perspective and a user's changes drastically. Recalling my personal experience, I have also used lightboxes to have a design work in my favor. When doing so, I did not consider the problems it creates but rather how convenient the feature is for me.

                The article caught my attention for the WHO and WHEN considerations. Disorientation for mobile users requires attention to detail, and I had not thought of the possibility of screen-magnifier users. For the WHEN, it makes sense to introduce overlays before a user works on their task. Or, if the overlay is their goal, then having it user-initiated gives control to the user. Overall, the article made me rethink the purposes of overlays and how they should only display for urgent matters or data collection.
